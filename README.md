# Ship Game (To be named)

This is a 2D space game based upon the DCPU-16. It's a work in progress, nothing is concrete.

This isn't much to play so far, so the term 'game', is a bit of a stretch, but at the moment you can control the ship by writing programs for the DCPU-16.

Take a look at the [hardware specs](https://github.com/lucaspiller/ship-game/tree/master/docs/hardware)
and [sample programs](https://github.com/lucaspiller/ship-game/tree/master/programs).

The graphics are based on another game I wrote, [88etag](https://github.com/lucaspiller/88etag), but will probably change.

You can play it at [http://lucaspiller.github.io/ship-game/](http://lucaspiller.github.io/ship-game/).

Take a look at the [design document](https://github.com/lucaspiller/ship-game/blob/master/docs/design.md) for more details.
