This folder contains sample programs for the game. The `.dasm` files are assembly code, and the `.dcpu` files are binaries that can be loaded into the system.

You'll need a DCPU assembler to make your own programs. I'm currently using a custom assembler (which may be released eventually), but the following appear to work, though are not extensively tested:

* [BlusDAS by Jon Povey](https://github.com/jonpovey/das)
* [DASM by PaulTech / TechCompliant](https://github.com/paultech/dasm)

Take a look at the [hardware specifications](https://github.com/lucaspiller/ship-game/tree/master/docs/hardware) for more details on the assembly format and instructions.
