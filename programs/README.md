This contains same programs. The `.dasm` files are assembly code, and the `.dcpu` files are binaries that can be loaded into the system. You'll need a DCPU assembler to make your own, I'm using a custom assembler (will be released eventually), but the [assembler for TechCompliant](https://github.com/paultech/dasm) is mostly compatible.

Take a look at the [hardware specifications](https://github.com/lucaspiller/ship-game/tree/master/docs/hardware) for more details.
